# Certificate demos using nginx and docker

Note that this was developed on a windows machine, so some of the
scripts may not work in other environments :(

# Before you start

If running in msys/windows, run `export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`, otherwise
docker doesn't understand msys's file paths.

# Simple http servers

Just demonstrating some simple nginx and docker functionality.

Run `./01_simple_http_server.sh`, and browse to localhost in any web browser.

Run `./02_http_port_81_config.sh`, and browse to localhost:81 in any web browser. This
demonstrates custom nginx configuration, and serving from a non-standard port.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# https server

Using a self-signed certificate, we can serve content over https.

Create a key pair using openssl: `./03_gen_cert.sh`. Just press enter
on each prompt for default values in the certificate.

# todo

- what is the cert generated by the 03 script? is is a request, a cert?
    how does it compare to a DigiCert?
- use certs with passwords
