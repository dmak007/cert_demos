# Certificate demos using nginx and docker

# Before you start

If running in msys/windows, run `source 00_init_env.sh`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Simple http servers

Just demonstrating some simple nginx and docker functionality.

Run `./01_simple_http_server.sh`, and browse to localhost in any web browser.

Run `./02_http_port_81_config.sh`, and browse to localhost:81 in any web browser. This
demonstrates custom nginx configuration, and serving from a non-standard port.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# https server

Using a self-signed certificate, we can serve content over https.

Run `03_https_server.sh`, and browse to https://localhost. You should
see a security warning in your browser. This is because the browser
doesn't trust the self-signed certificate used by this server.

The certificate is in `certs/03.crt`. This was created using the
script `03_gen_cert.sh`.

You can use openssl to view the certificate with the following command

`openssl x509 -in certs/03.crt -text -noout`

- `text`:  outputs the certificate in text format
- `noout`: disables output of the encoded certificate

# todo

- what is the cert generated by the 03 script? is is a request, a cert?
    how does it compare to a DigiCert?
- use certs with passwords
